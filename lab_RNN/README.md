# Text classification with RNN
Task to create RNN from scratch  to classify text.

* Lab RNN_base: Pre-treatment of data, building and evaluation of basic RNN model
* Lab RNN_transfer_learning: Own exploration of transfer learning using tranformers/Huggingface and Keras_NLP API

*NOTE: Current lab is not aiming at defining optimal model. Focus is rather on roughly exploring some basic concepts using very limited hardvare resources (CPU or GoogleColab limited GPU).*
