# Image classification with CNN
Task to create CNN  to classify images of flowers from Kaggle dataset.

* Lab a: Pre-treatment of data, building and evaluation of basic CNN model
* Lab b: Transfer learning from established models and systematical tuning of hyperparameters

*NOTE: Current lab is not aiming at defining optimal model. Focus is rather on roughly exploring some basic concepts using very limited hardvare resources (CPU or GoogleColab limited GPU).*
